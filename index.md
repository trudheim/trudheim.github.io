When I say "musings", I mostly mean "random flickers of thought briefly passing
through grey matter". I make no claim on correctness although I attempt to
actually verify things. I make no warranty that you will not get upset or angry
reading this, because you may disagree with me. Engage in discussion, be
openminded, be willing to journey down a path of mutual education, be willing
to see another perspective.
