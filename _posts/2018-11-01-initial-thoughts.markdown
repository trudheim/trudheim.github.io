Some initial words while I get to grips with [Jekyll][jekyll-home].

I am european and that colours my view of the world. At the political spectrum,
I guess you could say I fall in the humanist liberal socially democratic
equality category. I am not in favour of authoritarianism, despotism, oligarchy,
corruption, nepotism, organised religion, unfettered capitalism or nationalism.
I also take a dim view of the egoism that is so hyped by the more right-leaning
politicians. I can and most likely will launch in to a more detailed elaboration
on that topic in a later post.

Prewarning - I know from history that I have a habit of writing and then taking
breaks from writing. Sometimes I take yearlong breaks. I could promise I will
try better this time, but why try. Either I do, or I do not. We will see.

Check out the [Counter Social][counter-social] for a social media platform that
actually values mutual respect, learning and discussion. Trolls not welcome and
not tolerated.
